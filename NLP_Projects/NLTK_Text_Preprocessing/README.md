NLTK - Text Preprocessing

Goals of the project:
- Learn to use the nltk package to perform tokenization, remove stopwords, display the frequency distribution, lemmatization and display word clouds
- Import the text file to be analyzed
- Peform the following:
	- Sentence Tokenization using sent_tokenize from nltk.tokenize
	- Word Tokenization using word_tokenize from nltk.tokenize
	- Remove Punctuation from the array with tokenized words
	- Remove stop words from the same array using stopwords from nltk.corpus
	- Perform Lemmatization using WordNetLemmatizer from nltk.stem
	- Display the frequency distribution of the words
	- Display two word clouds using the same text file 
		1. One without including the stop words
		2. Another using the frequency distribution of the lemmatized words
